# Perceptual-Texture-Similarity-Prediction  
Introduction  
Prediction of perceptual similarity is a challenging task as in most cases we lack human labeled ground-truth data and robust models to
mimic human visual perception. This paper propose a new method to predict the fine-grained perceptual similarity between two texture images.
